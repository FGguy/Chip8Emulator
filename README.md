# Chip-8 Emulator
  - Why? I felt like getting into emulation and on reddit and other forums they all recommended starting with this simple project.
  - I used these sources:
    *  https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/
    *  https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/
  - I used SDL2 to handle user input and graphics.
  - The filepath to the rom needs to be provided as a command-line argument to the executable.
> I reckon I could have added a class for handling graphics, IO and audio to make everything more modular, readable and cleaner but
this project is too small for me to deem it necessary,I will definitely do so in my future emulator projects though.
